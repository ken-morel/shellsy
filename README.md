Good day pythonista!

I am here to present to you: shellsy, what is :question:

In your browsing or learning time you surely have used or made several tools,
for:

- Checking sql injection faults
- Or hiding files in images
- Or more

Shellsy brings you a simple way to build and combine all those your tools
in a ready to use, extensible shell application.

Looking also for new feautures, commands or types to integrate in shellsy, so
if you have an idea, please issue it in the bugtracker.

How'a'works?, lets see:

# Shellsy command structure.

In shellsy each command has this structure:

```
{command Name} {positional arguments} {keyword value arguments} {keyword boolean arguments}
```

Well, that is pretty simple, but  the power of shellsy actually comes from what
we can place there.

# Installation

Shellsy is not yet on pip, so you can download it from github

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/ken-morel/shellsy.git
cd shellsy/src
pip install .
```

And have it installed.
Please, the installation have only be tested on windows and I know that
part could be sensible to failures. If you have one, please issue.

# Using shellsy

run the shellsy command, from your terminal

```powershell
shellsy
             OR
python -m shellsy
```

the structure is as explained above. This is an example of a shellsy session.

```bash

```
